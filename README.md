<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

<p>I pulled all the data from https://swapi.dev/ all of the images were pulled from Google.  I wanted to create a character grid that created a Modal, and in each different character it would pull different data specific to them.  I decided to use specific characters instead of pulling every character from the list.  I pulled data from a different character page and assigned their name to the ID's.  I then created a function that would grab the name of the ID when clicked, and did a $.get to use a search URL + the ID I clicked and the data from the site.  Then I assigned the specific characteristics to ID's.  I also used a carousel of images at the top of my page to cycle through some images.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

I wasn't a big fan of how my modal was functioning, trying to style my modal was a problem for some reason, it would not load what I wanted it to do or it would just completely not load the information.  I wanted to change it from a modal to a card flip but it was too late and ran out of time.
